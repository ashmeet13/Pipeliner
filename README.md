# Pipeliner
Figuring out Data Pipelines.


There are way too many frameworks one can use while constructing a Data Pipeline.
This project should allow a user to try and test out a new framework by just plugging in the framework into the compose.

The project is early stages of ideating. Any review and reccomendations is welcome!
